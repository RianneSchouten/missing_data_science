Missing Data in Data Science: simulations
=========================================

.. role:: pyth(code)
  :language: python

This folder contains all simulation code that is used to run the simulations as described in the blogpost_ and as presented in the interactive plot_.

The structure of the folder is as follows:

- **scripts:** a folder with Jupyter Notebook simulation scripts
    - generate_data.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook used to generate simulated datasets
    - import_real_data.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook used to import and slighly adapt four real datasets
    - evaluation_complete_data.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook used to calculate the evaluation error metrics in the complete datasets
    - simulations.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook used to perform the simulations
- **data:** a folder with the real and simulated datasets
- **results:** a folder with the saved text files that are generated as outcome of the simulation.ipynb script
