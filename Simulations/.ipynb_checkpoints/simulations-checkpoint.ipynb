    "In this script, we perform simulations to explore the effect of several missing data techniques on the outcome of a regression analysis. We work with two real, example datasets (imported with file: import_real_data.ipynb) and four custom datasets (created in the file: generate_data.ipynb). We c an amputation function and generated multiple forms of missing data. We deal with the missing data by the following missing data methods: drop, mean imputation, median imputation, regression imputation, stochastic regression imputation and random imputation. "
